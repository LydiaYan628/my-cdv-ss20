# Response to "The Rise of Surveillance Capitalism"

It might be a coincidence that this topic discussed by Shoshana Zuboff is exactly what my Writing as Inquiry course is going to read and write about next week.

1. To my understanding, surveillance capitalism is a realistic situation in today's daily life.
It is a situation that companies take the behavioral data they have collected from their tracking technologies into predictable yet profitable use. By predicting all the behavioral data, they may improve their service through analysis. Therefore, they can influence more on the real-life human experience, then be able to collect more data. It's a snowballing effect.
Under surveillance capitalism, human experiences are seen as commodity. Through exchanging and investigating from the data, new market may emerge from it. This whole process creates a chain.

2. Surveillance Capitalism is indeed a controversial issue in this digital era, we can bearly escape from being tracked by all kinds of technical software and devices. However, there is a point that I can not agree with what Zuboff has suggested.
Shoshana argues that the asymmetric information under surveillance capitalism which the companies know a lot about us, and we barely know anything about them. It is unfair and harmful, the information will only profit the companies and we are not benefiting from it at all. I think that's not true, these data are also beneficial to us. Maybe it seems that in normal life, we don't have a chance to use these data. But once we come across the circumstance that these data are pretty crucial for our own safety, for instance, when one of your beloved ones get lost, then the surveillance tools may become extremely helpful. In this case, I think it is better safe than sorry.
