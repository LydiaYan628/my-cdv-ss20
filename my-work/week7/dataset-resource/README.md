# Dataset sources

### 1. [Trust](https://ourworldindata.org/trust)
This is a dataset masures how well does people from each country trust each other, the public institutions and comparison between the individual and the public trust. This dataset also allows us to see the "trust value" changes through different years. It also provides the relationship between "trust value" and cultural, economic and social causes, such as religion, GDP, education and so on.

For visualization, other than the ones which are already shown on the website, which are already awesome, I can also see the world's trust trend to different facilities. May be I will show the data with two human faces looking at or away from each other and the mouth arc can also directly represent the "trust rate". I can also compare the "trust rate" between different public institutions and to see the most trust institution in different country and its changes through years.

### 2. [Loneliness & Social Connections](https://ourworldindata.org/social-connections-and-loneliness)
This is a rich dataset that present both lonliness measures and the use of social media and technology adoptions. I am more interested in the social media usage than the lonliness data, because the lonliness is hard to be accurate for they are all self measured and can be affected by a lot of external causes. The social media and technology part of this dataset shows the population and the revolution of each media platform and technological product. There are also human engagenment measures while using these media platforms.

I want to create a "media palace" that shows the occupation of each technology product through out the years, the most used ones will be the king and the prince and so on. I can also create a digital soent time clock that shows the tiem spent on different devices through years and a "world  clock" to show the differences among countries.

### 3. [TV Shows and Movies listed on Netflix](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows)
This dataset shows the TV series and movies avaliable on Netflix in 2019. The data collected the type, country, ratingï¼Œrelease year, etc.

Maybe I will make use of the logo, and fill it out by different areas to show the occupation of each catagory.
