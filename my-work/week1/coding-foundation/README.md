This is my coding foundation work.

I did a little adaption and made it into a snowy page.

But the snowflakes appear from the bottom of the page and they fall down as the number increases.

I was stucked when I messed up with id and class and it took me HOURS (yes, HOURS) to debug :disappointed_relieved:

Should watch out next time
